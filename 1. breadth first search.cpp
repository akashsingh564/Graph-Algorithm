Well I really liked you right from the very first day. Then slowly slowly as i watched you, got to know you and soon enough that likiness developed into admiration and a huge crush.
I tries my best to sit next in the seat adjusnt to yours, I copied your number from the attence list and there has been few other crazy stuff that I did. I once even almost followed you to your home.
Remeber the prank call you had where you sang a song, that was me, i wanted to hear your voice so badly that day!

You mist be wondering why am i telling you all this! Because a crazy part me belived that i can have you... still, even after all these years. But I have realized that this is a lost cause, I may be comming too strong on to you and then 
I saw your DP and connected the dots myself. I guess you are taken, so i needed my closure to get over it. Remember me, you will always find a friend in me. Good bye.. Love you!
